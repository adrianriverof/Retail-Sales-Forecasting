## Overview

This project develops state-of-the-art machine learning models (LightGBM) to predict sales for the next 8 days at a shop-product level, using 3 years of historical data from a large retailer. The system supports large-scale modeling, training multiple models in parallel.


## Challenges faced

- **Hierarchical data structure**:
we modeled sales at the **storeâ€“product level**, allowing the forecasts to reflect individual product demand in each store.  

- **Intermittent demand**: we created a variable to capture this effect and help making predictions about it.


- **Massive modeling**: to deal with having to model for multiple elements, we used the fast and light algorithm LightGBM.

- Forecasting for **several days in the future**: we use a recursive prediction. 
The model makes a prediction for the next day and then uses that prediction to estimate the following day. 




## Results


<i>For context, the average daily sales per product is around 20 units (25th-75th percentile: 6-37), but it varies greatly and depends heavily on the product.
</i>

- 1-day forecast average absolute error of less than 6 units sold.
- 8-day forecast average absolute error of 8.5 units sold.

<i> These metrics are just very rough estimates, but it is safe to say that it provides an adequate prediction of overall demand trends.
