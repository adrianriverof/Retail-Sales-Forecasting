# Retail Forecasting

## Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict the sales of the next 8 days at a shop-product level, using a database with 3 years of historic data from a big retailer. 

It uses last generation models (LightGBM) and features massive modeling to develop multiple models at the same time.


## Challenges (wip)

- Hierarchical forecasting
- Intermittent demand
- Massive modeling
- Forecasting for several days in the future


## Results


- 1-day forecast average absolute error of less than 6 units sold.
- 8-day forecast average absolute error of 8.5 units sold.

- Created scripts for [retraining](https://github.com/adrianriverof/forecasting-retail/blob/master/03_Notebooks/03_System/08_Retraining_code.py) and [execution](https://github.com/adrianriverof/forecasting-retail/blob/master/03_Notebooks/03_System/09_Execution_code.py) of the predictive model
